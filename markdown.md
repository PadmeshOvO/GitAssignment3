# Assignment-4
## Markdown
### Introduction
Markdown is a simple way to format text using some symbols. Itâ€™s commonly used to write
GitHub README files, documents for websites, blogs, and notes. Markdown syntax uses
special characters, like # for headings, ** ** for **bold text**, and ** for *Italics* or 1 for lists , making it easy to read and edit, even without special software. ~~This is for mistaken text.~~ **This text is _extremely_ important and uses nested italic and bold.**

***We are using this as an example for bold and italic text together.***
This is a ~subscript~ text.
This is a ^supersript^ text.
I'll write quoted text now.
> This is quoted text.

Now we'll try and quote code.
Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
